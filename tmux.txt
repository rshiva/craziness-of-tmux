TMUX basics

Startig tmux
  $ tmux

Exiting tmux
  $ exit

Creating named session which can be used we want the session to run the background
  $ tmux new-session -s session-name
     OR
  $ tmux new -s session-name

  Command Prefix 	: CRTL-b is way of telling the next command is for tmux and not the application its running


Attaching  

 In normal terminal if we close the terminal all the session would expire whereas in tmux its not the case.
 Any program we start in session will be running .

 We can see the list of tmux sessions running

  $ tmux list-sessions 
    OR
  $ tmux ls (if no name is provided the list session is named by numbers)


  Detaching from the session using (CRTL-b d)

We attach back to the session 

  $ tmux attach  (if only one session is running)

  $ tmux attach -t session-name 

We can kill the session by 

  $ exit (within the tmux session )
    OR
  $ tmux kill-session -t session-name

  It ask for confirmation before killing the window
  $ CRTL-b &    




  Creating a new window
    CRTL-b c

  Renaming window from default name , default name of the window will be the application its running 
  CRTL-b ,


  To navigate around the windows windows using
    CRTL-b n       (next)
    CRTL-b p       (previous)
    CRTL-b 0-9     (if you have more the windows)
    CRTL-b f       (to find the window by its name )
    CRTL-b w       (dsiplays visual menu of windows and you can select them)


Panes : In Tmux we can divide a single session in

Vertical split
  CRTL-b %

Horizontal split
 CRTL-b "

 We can navigate around the window using

 CRTL-b o
   OR
 CRTL-b arrow keys (UP , DOWN , LEFT , RIGHT)



Configuring Tmux

By default, tmux looks for configuration settings in two places. It first looks in /etc/tmux.conf for a system-wide configuration. It then looks for a file called .tmux.conf in the current userâ€™s home directory

set -g prefix C-a

- g is global which set the option for all tmux session 
Now the prefix is CTRL-a

set -g base-index 1

the window index will start at 1 when creating multiple window session

pane-base-index

We can target the pane using the format [session_name][window][pane] eg. development:1.2


tmux send-keys -t development:1.2 'cd ~/devproject' C-m

This will open the devproject in second pane

Below command will create new window with name console and next line will go the path in the second window we have created

tmux new-window -n console -t development 
tmux send-keys -t development:2 'cd ~/path' C-m

select the window when we start the session

tmux select-window -t development:1


chmod +x file_name  --  to create  a shell script for tmux and run using ./filename
